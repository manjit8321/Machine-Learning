### Decision Tree Regression

Decision tree regression builds a predictive model in the form of a tree structure. It recursively partitions the dataset into smaller subsets, creating a tree where each node represents a decision based on the input features, and each leaf node represents a predicted outcome.

### Key Points

1. **Tree Structure**: The model is represented as a binary tree, with internal nodes representing decisions on an attribute and leaf nodes representing the regression output.

2. **Partitioning**: The dataset is split into smaller subsets based on feature values, aiming to reduce variance in each subset.

3. **Decision Nodes**: These nodes make decisions based on the feature values, splitting the data into branches.

4. **Leaf Nodes**: These nodes represent the predicted values, which are the outputs of the model for given input features.

5. **Advantages**:
   - Simple to understand and interpret.
   - Can handle both numerical and categorical data.
   - Nonlinear relationships between features do not affect the performance.

6. **Disadvantages**:
   - Prone to overfitting, especially with noisy data.
   - Can be unstable as small variations in the data might result in a completely different tree.
   - Biased towards features with more levels.
